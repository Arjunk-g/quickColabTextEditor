# quickColabTextEditor
A quick and collaborative text editor.

Started by creating server and client folders. 
Client folder contains the code for a simple react app.
Ran create-react-app client to create boilerplate react app to start off with
Remember to cd into the apps directory as well as the client folder since the two have seemed to merge, to recall:
'cd client' then
'cd quick-colab-text-editor'
Then run 'npm start' to start the react app.
Installed Quill and added a file to the src folder
